# Enterprise AI Development Platform - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building an **Enterprise-Grade AI-Powered Development Platform**. The platform combines collaborative chat with specialized AI agents that work together to build actual applications, prototypes, and code - featuring multi-agent orchestration, real-time collaborative coding rooms, vibe-based themes, and enterprise features.

**Vision:** Create a premium, enterprise-ready AI development platform where teams collaborate with specialized AI agents (Architect, Coder, Reviewer, Debugger, etc.) to build real applications - combining the communication of Slack, the AI power of multiple models working together, and the coding capabilities of Replit Agent.

**Key Differentiator:** Unlike traditional chat platforms, this is a **hybrid coding platform** where:
- Multiple AI agents with specialized roles work together
- Teams collaborate in real-time coding rooms
- AI agents generate actual working code, not just suggestions
- Different models handle different tasks (GPT-4 for planning, Claude for coding, etc.)
- Built-in code execution, preview, and deployment

**Base Technology:** Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Vercel Postgres + Vercel KV (Redis) + Multi-Agent AI Orchestration
