## Overview
Phase 4 adds comprehensive collaborative coding rooms with real-time synchronization, enabling multiple users to code together seamlessly.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 4 core tasks completed successfully!

## What Was Built

### 1. Room Management
- Create/read/update/delete rooms
- Join/leave functionality
- Password protection
- Public/private/team visibility
- Participant management
- Role-based access control

### 2. Real-Time Synchronization
- Socket.io server integration
- Real-time code editing
- Cursor position tracking
- File tree synchronization
- Chat messaging
- Theme synchronization

### 3. Operational Transformation
- Conflict-free concurrent editing
- Operation transformation algorithms
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Consistent state across all users

### 4. Access Control
- Authentication required
- Role-based permissions (host, moderator, participant)
- Password hashing
- Participant limits

## Quick Start

### Create a Room

```typescript
import { getRoomManager } from '@/lib/rooms/room-manager';

const manager = getRoomManager();
const room = await manager.createRoom({
  name: 'My Coding Room',
  visibility: 'private',
  maxParticipants: 10,
  password: 'secret123',
}, 'user-123');
```

### Join a Room

```typescript
const participant = await manager.joinRoom({
  roomId: 'room-123',
  userId: 'user-456',
  password: 'secret123',
});
```

### Socket.io Connection

```typescript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:3000', {
  path: '/api/socket',
});

socket.emit('room:join', {
  roomId: 'room-123',
  userId: 'user-123',
});

socket.on('code:changed', (data) => {
  // Apply code changes
});
```
